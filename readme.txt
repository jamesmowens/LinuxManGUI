NOTE: This project uses Java 8 syntax including lambda. In order to run it you will need to have Java 8 installed on your computer. 

Open project in IntiJ idea (I'm using 2016.1.3)
Run the class man-> main

If you recive errors about either lamda expression or Java 8 declaration syntax make sure jdk and interpreter are set of java 8. file->project structure
